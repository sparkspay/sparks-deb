sparkscore (0.12.4.2) testing; urgency=medium

 * This version fixes a random crash which occurs on some nodes. Also, 
   we decided to drop old nodes which generate a lot of noise on the network.

   Please update and RESYNC (not reindex) your hot wallets and masternodes.
   Masternodes need to be restarted using start-alias after update.

   Due to the enforced new protocol, old nodes will not be able to connect to the network.*

sparkscore (0.12.4.1) testing; urgency=medium

* This version fixes problems with masternode starting / restarting, 
  guardian nodes outputs and a few other things. The problems will 
  start to disappear when the majority of nodes are updated. Meanwhile 
  you might notice some discrepancies in the masternode list, as some of 
  the older nodes don't recognize new nodes. When starting a new 
  masternode, the start command may fail, until a path is found from 
  your updated hot wallet to your new MN, which contains only updated 
  nodes. (ie. a start command from a 0.12.4.1 node which is connected 
  to a 0.12.4 client will not be broadcasted to other 0.12.4.1 peers).
