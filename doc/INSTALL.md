# SparksCore 0.12.3.5 - 0.12.4 
Prevered System => debian 9, ubuntu 16.04 +  
Min Sysspecs => 1 CPU, 1Ghz, 1GB RAM, 2GB SWAP, 20GB HDD  

### Files and more
Everybody who is not interested **SKIP** this info.  
After sucessfull installation there will be a config folder in  
**/opt/sparks**. This folder is not removed after install because you  
could reinstall the package in terms of multible sparks installation   
with multiIP settings.  
  
The sparksd.service is started with the -disablewallet flag, so if  
you are choosing the hot-cold wallet mode you need no walletfunction on
server.  
  
People who don't want to run a hot wallet on another system (ie Windows)  
need to remove the startup parameter from sparksd.service an easy  
command for this would be ...

```` bash
root@server:~# sed -i "s/\-disablewallet//g" /etc/systemd/system/sparksd.service
### don't forget ###
root@server:~# systemctl daemon-reload
root@server:~# systemctl restart sparksd
````  
  
Sparks will be installed in your **~/.sparkscore** home directory so don't  
forget to change parameters (ie masternodeprivkey) to fit your needs.  

#### ALL DONE
Then enable sparksd.service on startup
````
root@server:~# systemctl enable sparksd
````

## PreInstall process 
It's good to have a nonpriviledged user configured! Add user and  
put him into **sudo** group  
```` bash
### choose something else than sparky as username ###
root@server:~# adduser sparky && adduser sparky sudo

### forbit the root to login with ssh (optional) ###
root@server:~# nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

### CHANGE PARAMs TO ##
.
.
PermitRootLogin no
StrictModes yes
.
.

### before you you logout the server test it with new ssh session ###
root@server:~# systemctl restart sshd

````
### ATTANTION
If you don't plan to configure a new user and you change the **PermitRootLogin**  
in your ssh server to **no**, you'll never be able to login from ssh again!  
So before you logout the server test your login with your new configured user. If 
this works you are fine to continue.
